pyWebApp
========

An exploratory little web app and its own server.

See if we can write something close to a desktop application but running in
a web browser and doing AJAXy things with a local web server.

This sort of application is very easy to change into a traditional web app
and remote server.

The initial use for this is the webELoss application.  The server will serve
the HTML file and associated CSS/JS, as well as handling the "data save"
functionality.
